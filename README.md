# Project Portfolio

Hello! I'm Pranav, a Master of Business Analytics candidate at MIT, where my focus is on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Optimization. My interests lie mainly in developing data-driven decision-making systems that can adapt to and anticipate the complexities of todayâ€™s dynamic environment. 

My educational journey at MIT is an extension of a strong foundation in operations research cultivated during my bachelor's degree at IIT Delhi. There, I not only engaged in research projects focusing on mathematical modeling for large-scale stochastic systems but also ventured into management consulting with a Big 4 firm, integrating quantitative analysis to foster tangible business outcomes.

My professional and academic experiences span a diverse array of sectors including e-commerce, finance, healthcare, transportation, and tech industries. I am particularly passionate about the potential of Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning techniques to revolutionize our approach to problem-solving and decision-making.


## Projects and Collaborations

### Ongoing

#### Reward Shaping via Natural Language for Intuitive Human-Agent Interaction


This project proposes the development of a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates natural language processing to interpret and utilize natural language as the primary modality for reward functions. By leveraging pre-trained large language models to parse and deconstruct language into actionable instructions, the framework aims to map these instructions to specific actions within the RL environment. This approach allows for a dynamic and intuitive interaction between humans and AI, where commands given in natural language directly influence the learning and behavior of the agent. The project will initially be tested in controlled environments with predefined sets of possible instructions and actions, with the objective of expanding to more complex and less structured scenarios. This research seeks to bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding, potentially transforming how AI systems are trained and interacted with across various domains.

Our project uses detailed textual descriptions to enhance font design and handwriting generation. We aim to push the boundaries of personalized and stylistic text generation by using diffusion models to overcome limitations in typographic generation. This project aims to leverage diffusion models specifically tailored for typographic generation to advance font and handwriting synthesis. Focusing initially on font generation, we plan to use detailed text descriptions of font attributes and text content to train diffusion models to accurately reverse the process of noise addition, resulting in high-fidelity text rendering in a variety of styles. This approach leverages the strength of existing diffusion models while addressing their current limitations in generating nuanced text representations. By exploring both whole text and individual letter rendering techniques, and potentially extending to handwriting synthesis through sequence prediction of pen movements and pressure, our objective is to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and visual typographic outputs, pushing the boundaries of personalized text generation.

#### ClueMaster: An LLM-powered Crossword Puzzle Companion

Our study focused on the New York Times (NYT) crossword puzzles, noted for their distinctive clues and progressive difficulty levels. The primary aim of this project is to provide users with potential answers that are sensitive to the context and language intricacies of the clue and the structural constraints of the crossword puzzle, such as word length. We examined various methods, including BERT, zero/few-shot predictions, RAG, and fine-tuning techniques, and evaluated their effectiveness in navigating the linguistic terrain of NYT crossword puzzles. Through these models, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities of current LLM technologies and their suitability for addressing complex language-based challenges, exemplified by the nuances of NYT crossword puzzle clues.

### Sentiment-Enhanced Algorithmic Stock Trading Agent

This project aims to develop an intelligent trading agent capable of making real-time trading decisions informed by both historical market data and the sentiment derived from financial news and related articles. By utilizing a combination of sentiment analysis and Optimal Policy Trees (OPTs), we aim to capture the sentiment-driven fluctuations in the stock market alongside historical stock behaviour to optimize investment returns.

### Taxi Dispatch Decision Support System using Finite Horizon Formulation
This project proposes a data-driven project focused on optimizing the decision-making process for taxi drivers by leveraging historical ride data. Currently, taxi drivers rely on manual, case-by-case decision-making when deciding whether to accept or decline a trip. This approach leaves drivers susceptible to suboptimal choices, as they lack a comprehensive understanding of the potential profitability of each trip. Further, the algorithms currently in place in ride-hailing apps only consider optimizing overall trips, without granularity to optimize the earnings of individual drivers. The key objective is thus to develop an optimization model that guides taxi drivers in determining whether to accept or decline a trip based on potential returns for the day, considering factors such as distance, time of day, prices, and historical earnings

### Time-Series Forecasting for the Boston Bluebikes Service

This project analyzes the Bluebikes data to understand the factors influencing hourly and station-level bike usage to develop predictive models for hour-level bike demand. This insight is crucial for optimizing bike and dock allocations, particularly during peak hours, enhancing customer satisfaction and overall system efficiency. We employed a variety of modeling techniques to explore and predict bike usage patterns. Specifically, we used Linear Regression and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to examine baseline relationships between bike usage and various factors like weather conditions and temporal components like time of day and month. To predict overall demand based on numerical and categorical variables, we employed Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. We also explored time-series forecasting models, including Prophet and SARIMA, to account for seasonality and time-specific patterns.
