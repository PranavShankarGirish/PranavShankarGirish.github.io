# Project Portfolio

Hello! I'm Pranav, a Master of Business Analytics candidate at MIT, where my focus is on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Optimization. My interests lie mainly in developing data-driven decision-making systems that can adapt to and anticipate the complexities of todayâ€™s dynamic environment. 

My educational journey at MIT is an extension of a strong foundation in operations research cultivated during my bachelor's degree at IIT Delhi. There, I not only engaged in research projects focusing on mathematical modeling for large-scale stochastic systems but also ventured into management consulting with a Big 4 firm, integrating quantitative analysis to foster tangible business outcomes.

My professional and academic experiences span a diverse array of sectors including e-commerce, finance, healthcare, transportation, and tech industries. I am particularly passionate about the potential of Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning techniques to revolutionize our approach to problem-solving and decision-making.


## Projects and Collaborations
### AI Researcher | Accenture 
As part of my Master's at MIT, I am pursuing my capstone project (7-month collaboration) with Accenture's Data Science and Generative AI Research Team.

Our project focuses on the "GenAI future of work". We will be developing a system that enables companies to better navigate the impact of Generative AI on the composition of their workforce. The offering will include capabilities to perform a company-level analysis on how to redefine and redesign jobs, and how to optimally reskill their existing workforce to ensure that they are resilient to this change while maximizing overall productivity. 

Stay tuned for our progress on this project!


### Deep Learning Project
#### ClueMaster: An LLM-powered Crossword Puzzle Companion

Our study focused on the New York Times (NYT) crossword puzzles, noted for their distinctive clues and progressive difficulty levels. The primary aim of this project is to provide users with potential answers that are sensitive to the context and language intricacies of the clue and the structural constraints of the crossword puzzle, such as word length. We examined various methods, including BERT, zero/few-shot predictions, RAG, and fine-tuning techniques, and evaluated their effectiveness in navigating the linguistic terrain of NYT crossword puzzles. Through these models, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities of current LLM technologies and their suitability for addressing complex language-based challenges, exemplified by the nuances of NYT crossword puzzle clues.

### Machine Learning Project
#### Sentiment-Enhanced Trading Agent

This project aims to develop an intelligent trading agent capa-
ble of making real-time trading decisions informed by both historical market data and
the sentiment derived from financial news and related articles. By utilizing a combina-
tion of sentiment analysis and Optimal Policy Trees (OPTs), we aim to to capture the
sentiment-driven fluctuations in the stock market alongside historical stock behaviour to
optimize investment returns.

### Optimization Project
#### Taxi Dispatch Decision Support System using Finite Horizon Formulation
This project proposes a data-driven project focused on optimizing the decision-making process for taxi drivers by leveraging historical ride data. Currently, taxi drivers rely on manual, case-by-case decision-making when deciding whether
to accept or decline a trip. This approach leaves drivers susceptible to suboptimal choices,
as they lack a comprehensive understanding of the potential profitability of each trip.
Further, the algorithms currently in place in ride-hailing apps only consider optimizing
overall trips, without granularity to optimize the earnings of individual drivers. The key
objective is thus to develop an optimization model that guides taxi drivers in determining
whether to accept or decline a trip based on potential returns for the day, considering
factors such as distance, time of day, prices, and historical earnings

### Analytics Project

This project analyzes the BlueBike data to understand the factors influence ing hourly and station-level bike usage to develop predictive models for hour-level bike
demand. This insight is crucial for optimizing bike and dock allocations, particularly
during peak hours, enhancing customer satisfaction and overall system efficiency. We employed a variety of modeling techniques to explore and predict
bike usage patterns. Specifically, we used Linear Regression and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to examine baseline relationships between bike usage and various
factors like weather conditions and temporal components like time of day and month. To
predict overall demand based on numerical and categorical variables, we employed Linear
Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. We also explored time-series forecasting mod-
els, including Prophet and SARIMA, to account for seasonality and time-specific patterns.
